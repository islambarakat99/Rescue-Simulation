# Rescue-Simulation Game
This is a University project implemented during Spring 2019. 
It is acctually a game in which the player is trying to save as many citizens as they can,
where the citizens inside or outside the buildings suffer from disasters that could be:
Injury, Infection strike the citizen or
Gas Leak, Collapse, Fire strike the buildings which may have citizens.
There are some pre-existed Units that the player can use so the objective of the game is to rescue as much as
possible of the citizens before being deceased and the Units are:
Evacuator, Fire truck, Gas Control Unit, Ambulance, Disease Control Unit
